Specify a number of trials (integer greater than 0) and the simBM(n) command will both generate a dataframe as well as plot 2D browninan motion.


```{r}
library(brownmotion)
simBM(100)
```

You can also store the object (as a dataframe).

```{r}
x <- simBM(100)
```

The default standard deviation is 1, but that can be changed.
```{r}
simBM(100,sigma=2)
```
